_Note by Aneesha on 07-10-2024: _Edited this topic based on customer feedback that there is no information on how to access the Dev Dashboard. To improve the usability, edited the topic to include all integration types, including hosted checkout, plugins, and GDP-related info, with quick steps to complete in the Dev Dashboard. Prior to this edit, the topic started with the text on payment flows with disconnected info on integration types and tools and repetitive PCI info. Now, payment flow is available in a separate topic - [Ecommerce API: Accept payments flow](<>) - that is also linked from here. The left nav is organized with data model and permissions topics listed as subtopics below this topic and also listed in the Related topics section in this topic.

## Overview

Clover Ecommerce APIs and SDKs are designed to let you build custom apps and integrations that extend the functionality of the Clover platform to support ecommerce operations. You can build seamless Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant payment experiences for merchants. All payments and transactions with the Clover Ecommerce API are PCI compliant, which reduces the PCI compliance burden on app developers and Clover merchants. 

You can build PCI compliant payment integrations using the Clover-hosted iframe and API integrations to accept credit card information securely. A <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/secure-software/" target="_blank">PCI DSS certification</a> is required for production use of the API-only integration.

## Ecommerce integration types and tools

Apps can integrate with Clover Ecommerce services in various ways, tailored to the needs of the application and merchants. 

| Integration types and tools | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Related topic                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clover Hosted Checkout      | Embed the Clover-hosted checkout page into your website for a secure, PCI-compliant, and seamless payment experience. Customize the online shopping experience, such as the checkout page, to match the merchant's brand.                                           | [Hosted Checkout API](https://docs.clover.com/docs/hosted-checkout-api)                                            |
| Clover-hosted iframe        | Embed and customize a Clover-hosted payment form into your website using an inline frame (iframe). The <<glossary:iframe tokenizer>> securely collects card data and provides an encrypted token as a `source` token for subsequent transactions with the merchant. | [Clover iframe integrations](doc:clover-iframe-integrations)                                                       |
| REST API-only integration   | Use Clover APIs for custom integrations that require complete control over the payment flow or to integrate payment processing into existing systems with complex requirements. An API-only integration requires PCI DSS certification and additional services.     | [Ecommerce API tutorials](doc:ecommerce-api-tutorials)                                                             |
| Ecommerce SDK               | Choose the appropriate software development kit (SDK) for your ecommerce platform. Clover offers SDKs for various programming languages, providing pre-built components and libraries to simplify integration with the Clover Ecommerce APIs.                       | [Ecommerce software development kits (SDKs)](https://docs.clover.com/docs/ecomm-software-development-kits)         |
| Ecommerce plugins           | Use Clover payment extensions or plugins with no coding requirements. These plugins facilitate payment processing from websites powered by ecommerce platforms, such as WooCommerce or Adobe Commerce.                                                              | [Clover Payment extension for Ecommerce (US and Canada only)](https://docs.clover.com/docs/clover-payment-plugins) |

## Get started with the Global Developer Dashboard

As a developer, you can get started with building and testing your Ecommerce app integrations on the Global Developer Dashboard.

1. [Create a global developer account](https://docs.clover.com/docs/gdp-create-global-developer-account).
2. [Manage test merchant accounts and information](https://docs.clover.com/docs/gdp-manage-test-merchants-accounts).
3. [Create your app](https://docs.clover.com/docs/gdp-create-new-app) in the sandbox environment.
4. Configure [settings](https://docs.clover.com/docs/app-settings) and [permissions](https://docs.clover.com/docs/app-settings#edit-requested-permissions) that your app requires to access Clover merchant data. For more information, see [Ecommerce app permissions](https://docs.clover.com/docs/ecommerce-app-permissions).
5. Test your app integration in the sandbox environment to simulate different settings and scenarios, including the steps to authenticate and authorize.
   1. Create public and private merchant-specific API tokens to configure Clover payment integration to take online payments on your ecommerce site. <!-- See .... add a link to the standalone topic; reference: https://docs.clover.com/docs/setting-up-an-api-token -->
   2. Generate an OAuth token to complete the Ecommerce API authorization flow. See [Authenticate with OAuthâ€”Canada and US](https://docs.clover.com/docs/use-oauth).
   3. Tokenize customer cards using the Clover [Ecommerce API](https://docs.clover.com/reference/createcharge)and then complete the steps to create a charge or pay for an order. See [Generate a card token](https://docs.clover.com/docs/ecommerce-generating-a-card-token).
6. Recreate your tested app in the production environment by following steps similar to those in the sandbox environment.
7. Use your [approved developer account](https://docs.clover.com/docs/approval) in the production environment to submit your app integration for approval.
