Use the [Create a charge](https://docs.clover.com/reference/createcharge) endpoint to charge a credit cards or other payment sources. See [Clover Ecommerce basics](https://docs.clover.com/docs/clover-development-basics-ecommerce) before you start creating a charge.

The best practice is to initially create a charge in the sandbox environment so that any given payment source, such as a credit card, is not charged.

## Prerequisites

1. Set up a [sandbox developer account](https://docs.clover.com/docs/setup-clover-sandbox-account).
2. [Create an app in the sandbox](https://docs.clover.com/docs/creating-a-sandbox-app). See also [Ecommerce app permissions](https://docs.clover.com/docs/ecommerce-app-permissions).
3. [Generate a card token](https://docs.clover.com/docs/ecommerce-generating-a-card-token). You need to generate a new card token for each payment.

## Steps

1. Send a POST request to the `v1/charges` endpoint to create a charge.
2. Enter the required parameters in the request:
   1. `amount`
   2. `currency`
   3. `source`
3. Use the `source` token from the `v1/charges` endpoint to create and pay for orders and accept tips. For example, to process a payment with your app, use the `v1/charges` endpoint to autocreate an order and perform the transaction. The payment is charged to a `source`, which is a credit card or debit card tokenized with the hosted tokenizer.

## Request example

The following table describes the request parameters to create a charge:

```curl
curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://scl-sandbox.dev.clover.com/v1/charges' \
     --header 'Accept: application/json' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ab86a5e8-48f3-b3bd-8c45-d415e9867833' \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'x-forwarded-for: {client_ip}' \
     --data '{"ecomind":"ecom"}'\
```

## Multi Currency Pricing (MCP)

Clover offers multi-currency pricing by allowing local currency codes in the currency field. Merchants in Canada and can accept payment, and submit refunds in regional currencies with settlement currency as USD. Once the customer completes the transaction in their submitted currency, Clover uses the current exchange rate at the time of authorization to estimate the paid amount in USD. This amount displays in the merchant's closeout report. 

To use this feature, merchants need to create a charge with a currency other than USD, and the MCP allows the gateway to accept it for authentication. Clover supports MCP only for Mastercard<sup>®</sup> and Visa<sup>®</sup>. Hence, make sure your merchants submit charges in USD for any other network transactions.

**Example: **A US merchant expands their online market and starts servicing in London through e-commerce and can now accept payments in euros.

**Note:** The digital receipt displays transaction details in the currency selected by the customer, and the transactions detail screen displays the settlement amount in the merchant’s local currency.
