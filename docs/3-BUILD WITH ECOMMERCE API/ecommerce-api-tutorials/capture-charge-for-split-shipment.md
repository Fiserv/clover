A split shipment is when a single order containing multiple products is sent in separate shipments due to product availability or sizing issues. The multi-capture feature allows merchants to split any payment into several captures initiated from a single authorization within a specified time frame. The pre-auth period for a split shipment depends on the card type.

To use the split-shipment feature, merchants need to contact the merchant help desk to get access to multi-capture setting on the Merchant dashboard. Once the support team provides access, merchants can enable or disable this feature from the **Merchant Web Dashboard â†’ Account & Setup â†’ Ecommerce Payments â†’ Multi-Capture**.

**Note: **The split-shipment feature is enabled globally in the sandbox environment for the test merchants to test the feature.

The `split_shipment` field in the  [Capture a charge](https://docs.clover.com/reference/capturecharge) endpoint allows you to capture a single pre-authorization multiple times. When you enter information in the field, a separate capture request is sent for shipment. See [Create pre-authorization](https://docs.clover.com/docs/create-pre-authorization) for more information.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Tips are charged with the first split-shipment amount. However, taxes and the surcharge are charged on a prorated basis for each split shipment.

## Create split shipment

1. Create preauth using `v1/charges/`. See [Create pre-authorization](https://docs.clover.com/docs/create-pre-authorization).
2. Send a `POST` request to `/v1/charges/{{charge_id}}/capture`.

**Example:**

```json JSON request
POST /v1/charges/{{charge_id}}/capture
{
    "amount": "150",
    "split_shipment": "1/3"
```
```json JSON response
{
    "id": "1AB2CDEF3G4H",
    "amount": 150,
    "payment_method_details": "card",
    "currency": "usd",
    "created": 1656626930000,
    "description": "this is split shipment",
    "captured": true,
    "ref_num": "316300528100",
    "auth_code": "723015",
    "order": "KQ2J82T5ZCYEM",
    "outcome": {
        "network_status": "approved_by_network",
        "type": "authorized"
    },
    "paid": true,
    "status": "succeeded",
    "source": {
        "id": "clv_1ABCD23efghI45JklmN6o7p",
        "brand": "MC",
        "first6": "123456",
        "last4": "1234"
    }
}
```

## Cancel the balance from the pre-authorization

Send a `PUT` request to `v1/charges/{{charge_id}}` to make the adjustment call to release the remaining balance from the pre-auth.

**Example:** The original pre-auth is for $10.00, and the first split shipment was captured for $4.40. The PUT call immediately releases the remaining balance ($5.60). 

```json JSON request
PUT v1/charges/{{charge_id}}
{
    "amount": "440"
}
```
```json JSON response
{
    "id": "94V2KC7YASTE2",
    "amount": 150,
    "payment_method_details": "card",
    "currency": "usd",
    "created": 1686587177000,
    "description": "this is split shipment",
    "captured": true,
    "ref_num": "316300528100",
    "auth_code": "723015",
    "order": "KQ2J82T5ZCYEM",
    "outcome": {
        "network_status": "reversed_after_approval"
    },
    "paid": true,
    "status": "succeeded",
    "source": {
        "id": "clv_1ABCD23efghI45JklmN6o7p",
        "brand": "MC",

        "last4": "2435"
    },
    "amount_captured": 1150
}
```
