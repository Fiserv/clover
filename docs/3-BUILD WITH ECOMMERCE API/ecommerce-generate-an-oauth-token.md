<meta name=" description" content="Learn about the OAuth API token. You need the token to secure the communication between your app and the merchant, and then to give your app the required permissions to access the merchant's data." >

# Overview

To secure communication between your app and the merchant, you need an OAuth API token. The OAuth token is required to:

- Complete the Ecommerce API authorization flow that grants your app the necessary permissions to access the merchantâ€™s data. 
- Generate a PAKMS key or `apiAccessKey`, from the Public Access Key Management Service (PAKMS). The PAKMS key identifies the merchant who is tokenizing the customers' cards. You can use the same static PAKMS key to tokenize multiple cards for that merchant.

There are two ways to generate an OAuth API token:

- In the legacy v1 OAuth flow for apps created before August 2024, and not migrated to using expiring tokens, this API token is known as an `auth_token`. See[ Generate API token with the legacy OAuth flow](https://docs.clover.com/docs/ecommerce-generate-an-oauth-token#generate-api-token-with-the-legacy-oauth-flow).
- In the v2 OAuth flow for all new apps created after August 2024, this OAuth API token is an expiring token, which is an `access_token` and `refresh token` combination. See [Generate OAuth expiring (access and refresh) token](https://docs.clover.com/docs/ecommerce-generate-an-oauth-token#generate-oauth-expiring-access-and-refresh-token).

# Terminology

The following terms are used in the OAuth flow to generate an OAuth token:

**Legacy v1 OAuth flow**

# Prerequisites

Before you can get an OAuth API token, you need to complete the following tasks: 

1. [Create a global developer account](https://docs.clover.com/docs/gdp-create-global-developer-account).
2. [Manage test merchant accounts and information](https://docs.clover.com/docs/gdp-manage-test-merchants-accounts).
3. [Create your app](https://docs.clover.com/docs/gdp-create-new-app) in the sandbox environment.
4. Configure [settings](https://docs.clover.com/docs/app-settings) and [permissions](https://docs.clover.com/docs/app-settings#edit-requested-permissions) that your app requires to access Clover merchant data. For more information, see [Ecommerce app permissions](https://docs.clover.com/docs/ecommerce-app-permissions).

In production, your application server needs to handle the merchant user, who is redirected from Clover to your server, once they connect to your app. To build the OAuth flow for apps on the [Clover App Market](https://www.clover.com/appmarket), in production environments, replace `https://sandbox.dev.clover.com/` with the base URL in your requests for United States (US) and Canada: `https://www.clover.com/`

# Generate API token with the legacy OAuth flow

1. Log in to the [Global Developer Dashboard](https://www.clover.com/fusionauth/oauth2/authorize?client_id=8c4b9ac9-c55b-4ee1-b978-30ea9edbf552&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.clover.com%2Fglobaldeveloperexperience%2Fcallbacks%2Fredirect-login&scope=openid%20offline_access).
2. Navigate to the Merchant Dashboard for your test merchant.
3. From the left navigation menu, select your test application. Clover redirects to your application.
4. If you have not yet coded your application server to handle the redirect and obtain an access token, note the `client_id` and the `code` in the URL.

      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "smart",
      "border": true
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


5. Send an API token GET request in the following URL format to the Clover /oauth/token server, passing the `client_id`, your `client_secret`, and `code`:

```text API token request URL format
https://sandbox.dev.clover.com/oauth/token?client_id={appId}&client_secret={APP_SECRET}&code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE}
```

The response displays your API access token.

```json API token response from server
{
   "access_token":"{API_TOKEN}"
}
```

# Generate OAuth expiring (access and refresh) token

The merchant clicks Connect on your app in the Clover App Market.  
The Clover App Market redirects the merchant to the location specified in the Alternate Launch Path field.  
The app calls /oauth/v2/authorize to initiate OAuth.

A merchant uses an app for the first time  
The merchant chooses an app from the appmarket  
The merchant will be redirected to /oauth/v2/authorize  
The merchant is prompted to log in (if not logged in already)  
The merchant is prompted to choose a merchant (if there is more than one under the account)  
The merchant is prompted to approve the app for access to merchant data  
The merchant is redirected to /a/v2/{appID}  
The merchant is redirected to the app callback URL with authorization token as query param  
The developer app makes a call to /oauth/v2/token to obtain an access and refresh token pair  
The developer app uses the access token to authenticate against a public API endpoint successfully
