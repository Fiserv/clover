The Ecommerce API returns error codes and messages when a request contains invalid or incomplete data and Clover cannot process the request. These issues can be divided into two general categories:

- Errors that should be addressed by your app's logic (if you are integrating with the API only) 
- Errors that should be handled at runtime (iframe and API integrations)

Errors you may encounter are explained the in the following sections.

## API only errors

You can prevent these errors by checking for the described issues in your application before submitting the API request.
