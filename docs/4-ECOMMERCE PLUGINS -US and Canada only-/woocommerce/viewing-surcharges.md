Surcharge is an additional fee that a merchant can charge buyers for accepting certain credit card transactions in some countries or regions. A merchant can configure surcharges in two ways:

- Use a plugin to calculate the surcharge amount.
- Use their Clover account to surcharge a credit card transaction. 

If the merchant is configured for surcharges on a specific Clover account, the customers can view an image on the e-commerce website, checkout `iframe` page, informing about the surcharge.

In the following image, the Note: in the Payment by card (Clover) section indicates that a surcharge may be applicable on credit card transactions.
