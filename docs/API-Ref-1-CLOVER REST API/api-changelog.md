### Inventory - Categories

#### :white_check_mark: New `colorCode` property

When creating or updating an item category, you can set a color to represent the category and make it easier for merchants to visually group items. This color code appears in the Register and Dining apps, as well as the Inventory page of the merchant web dashboard.
