## Watch the printing orders demo

Watch Clover's demo on how to print orders. Here's what you'll learn:

- Print orders on a merchant's default printer using the `print_event` endpoint
- Customize order and payment receipts

## Print API endpoints

The Print API consists of two endpoints providing access to the printer on a merchant's device. Online ordering or other restaurant-related apps can build features that depend on the ability to print order receipts. The following endpoints can used to interact with the printer functions:

- `POST /v3/merchants/{mId}/print_event` (requires the [Write orders](https://docs.clover.com/docs/permissions#write-orders) permission)
- `GET /v3/merchants/{mId}/print_event/{eventId}` (requires the [Read orders](https://docs.clover.com/docs/permissions#write-orders) permission)

Your app may also need to use the `GET /v3/merchants/{mId}/orders` endpoint to get information about existing orders.

## Printing an order to the default firing device

To print an order, your app sends a POST request to the `/v3/merchants/{mId}/print_event` endpoint with a request body including the order ID.

```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url https://sandbox.dev.clover.com/v3/merchants/{mId}/print_event \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"orderRef": {"id": "Y8TNWGTYHVP7G"}}'
```

This request is routed to the firing device's order printer or, if they don't have an order printer, to the firing device's onboard printer.

      ],
      "caption": "Data flow for order printing"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


The response includes the event `id`, the order being printed, the printer handling the request, as well as event state and time data.

```json
{
  "id": "P5WWTQ44VRY74",
  "orderRef": {
    "id": "4CZ8EH4BEKRXW"
  },
  "deviceRef": {
    "id": "926766ca-5636-8598-e959-6e3c6fe047e1"
  },
  "state": "CREATED",
  "createdTime": 1626454194000,
  "modifiedTime": 1626454194000,
  "printTime": 1626454194000
}
```

If you want to confirm that a print job is finished, your app should be [subscribed to the order event webhooks](https://docs.clover.com/docs/webhooks#subscribing-to-events). When an order is printed, Clover sets the `printed` property to `true` for each order line item. These line item updates are then sent to your app's callback URL as webhook messages.

## Getting the status of a recent print job

The `GET/v3/merchants/{mId}/print_event/{eventId}` endpoint returns information about a specific print job. Print jobs are short lived, so this endpoint only returns a response for jobs that are in the `CREATED`, `PRINTING`, or `FAILED` state. 

```curl
curl --request GET \
  --url https://sandbox.dev.clover.com/v3/merchants/{mId}/print_event/WNSZ2D0WX884W \
  --header 'Accept: application/json'
```
```json
{
  "id": "WNSZ2D0WX884W",
  "orderRef": {
    "id": "HQ6Q9WMX944SP"
  },
  "deviceRef": {
    "id": "926766ca-5636-8598-e959-6e3c6fe047e1"
  },
  "state": "PRINTING",
  "createdTime": 1626896196000,
  "modifiedTime": 1626896196000,
  "printTime": 1626896197000
}
```

Once a job is printed, the job is discarded and cannot be replayed. If you call this endpoint with the `eventId` of a job that has been successfully printed, the response is a message indicating `The print event is missing`.
