When you create orders, you can view order details and receipts using the **Orders** app on the Merchant Dashboard for your test merchant. The order receipt displays the order total breakdown.

The following example shows how to calculate order totals.

> ðŸ“˜ NOTE
> 
> When rounding decimal amounts smaller than a cent, such as tax per line item, calculate rounding with the round half up rule. For example, the rounding value of $33.654 is $33.65 and the rounding value of $33.455 is $33.46.

# Step 1: Line item calculations

Starting with the line item price, add any modifier costs.

In the following table, the cost of the `Avocado` and `Tofu` modifiers are $1.00 each. When you add the price of these modifiers to the `Caesar Salad` price, the subtotal with modifiers is $14.00 ($12.00 + $1.00 + $1.00). Similarly, the `Greek Salad` subtotal with modifiers is $12.00 ($10.00 + $1.00 + $1.00).

    "1-1": "$10.00",

# Step 2: Line item discounts

From the line item subtotal with modifiers:

1. Subtract any percentage discounts, and then
2. Subtract any numerical discounts.

In the following table, the value of the `Lunch deal` line item discount is $1.00. When you apply this discount to the `Caesar Salad` subtotal, the new subtotal after discounts is $13.00 ($14.00 - $1.00).

The value of the `25% off select salads` line item discount is 25% of the.`Greek Salad` subtotal (25% of $12.00 = $3.00). When you apply this discount to the `Greek Salad` subtotal, the new subtotal after discounts is $9.00 ($12.00 - $3.00).

| Line item    | Subtotal | Line item discounts   | Value | Subtotal after discounts |
| :----------- | :------- | :-------------------- | :---- | :----------------------- |
| Caesar Salad | $14.00   | Lunch deal            | $1.00 | $13.00                   |
| Greek Salad  | $12.00   | 25% off select salads | $3.00 | $9.00                    |
|              |          |                       |       | **$22.00**               |

# Step 3: Order-level discounts

From the subtotal after line item discounts:

1. Subtract any order-level percentage discounts and then
2. Subtract any order-level numerical discounts.

In the following table, the value of the `15th visit 15% off` order-level discount is 15% of each line item subtotal. When you subtract this discount from the `Caesar Salad` subtotal, the new subtotal after order-level discounts is $11.05 ($13.00 - $1.95). Similarly, the `Greek Salad` subtotal after order-level discounts is $7.65 ($9.00 - $1.35).

| Line item    | Subtotal | Order level discounts | Value | Subtotal after discounts |
| :----------- | :------- | :-------------------- | :---- | :----------------------- |
| Caesar Salad | $13.00   | 15th visit 15% off    | $1.95 | $11.05                   |
| Greek Salad  | $9.00    |                       | $1.35 | $7.65                    |
|              |          |                       |       | **$18.70**               |

# Step 4: Service charges

To the subtotal after order-level discounts, add any service charges.

In the following table, apply a service charge of 5% to the order subtotal after order-level discounts.

| Subtotal | Service charge rate | Service charge collected |
| :------- | :------------------ | :----------------------- |
| $18.70   | 5%                  | $0.94                    |

# Step 5: Taxes

To retrieve tax rates for order line items, send a `GET` request to `/v3/merchants/{mId}/orders/{orderId}/line_items?expand=taxRates`.

```json Sample response
{
    "elements": [
        {
            ...
            "name": "Greek Salad",
            "price": 1000,
            ...
            "taxRates": {
                "elements": [
                    {
                        "id": "6HA0Z3Z5DPCBC",
                        ...

                        "rate": 500000 // 5% tax applied to Greek Salad
                    }
                ]
            }
        },
        {
            ...
            "name": "Caesar Salad",
            "price": 1200,
            ...
            "taxRates": {
                "elements": [
                    {
                        "id": "77FAGR71YYD5M", // tax rate object
                        ...
                        "name": "Tax A",
                        "rate": 1000000 // 10% tax applied to Caesar Salad
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ],
    "href": "http://sandbox.dev.clover.com/v3/merchants/{mId}/orders/{orderId}/line_items?limit=100"
}
```

> ðŸš§ IMPORTANT
> 
> If `vat` is set to `true` in the merchant properties, the merchant uses a value-added tax. This means the tax amount is already included in the line item total and no additional amount should be added for tax.

Using the subtotal after order-level discounts (Step 3), calculate tax rates per taxable line item.

In the following table:

- Apply a 10% `Tax A` tax to `Caesar Salad`
- Apply a 5% `Tax B` tax to `Greek Salad`

| Line item    | Subtotal after discounts | Tax   | Tax rate | Tax collected |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :---- | :------- | :------------ |
| Caesar Salad | $11.05                   | Tax A | 10%      | $1.11         |
| Greek Salad  | $7.65                    | Tax B | 5%       | $0.38         |
|              |                          |       |          | **$1.49**     |

> ðŸ“˜ NOTE
> 
> If multiple line items in an order are taxed using the same tax rate object, Clover calculates taxes on the subtotal of those items. In the above example, if the same `Tax A` object of 10% is applied to the $11.05 and $7.65 values, calculate tax on the sum of these values.
> 
> ```
> ($11.05 + $7.65) * 0.10) = $1.87
> ```

See [Tax Reports: Examples](doc:tax-reports-examples) for more information about calculating taxes for line items.

# Step 6: Order total

The order total is the sum of the subtotal after any discounts, taxes, and service charges, if any.

In the following table, the order total is $21.51 ($18.70 + $1.87 + $0.94).

| Subtotal after discounts | Taxes | Service charges | Total      |
| :----------------------- | :---- | :-------------- | :--------- |
| $18.70                   | $1.49 | $0.94           | **$21.13** |

# Apply multiple tax rates to line items

A line item can have multiple tax rates. In the following table, each line item has the `Tax A` and `Tax B` applied to it.

| Line item    | Subtotal after discounts | Tax   | Tax rate | Tax collected |
| :----------- | :----------------------- | :---- | :------- | :------------ |
| Caesar Salad | $11.05                   | Tax A | 10%      | $1.11         |
|              |                          | Tax B | 5%       | $0.55         |
| Greek Salad  | $7.65                    | Tax A | 10%      | $0.77         |
|              |                          | Tax B | 5%       | $0.38         |
|              |                          |       |          | **$2.81**     |
