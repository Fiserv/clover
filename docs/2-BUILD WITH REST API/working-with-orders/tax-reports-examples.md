# Example 1: One Tax Applied to All Items

A merchant has one tax rate applied uniformly to all items. One tax, taxable amount matches sub-total of prices on the order. 

**Order** 

| Item      | Price      | Tax              | Tax rate | Tax collected | Subtotal   |
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------------- | :------- | :------------ | :--------- |
| Wrench    | $10.00     | Multnomah County | 5%       | $0.50         | $10.50     |
| Hammer    | $10.00     | Multnomah County | 5%       | $0.50         | $10.50     |
| **Total** | **$20.00** |                  |          | **$1.00**     | **$21.00** |

**Payment table** 

| Amount | Tax amount |
| :----- | :--------- |
| $21.00 | $1.00      |

**Payment tax rate table** 

| Taxable amount | Tax              | Tax rate |
| :------------- | :--------------- | :------- |
| $20.00         | Multnomah County | 5%       |

**Tax report** 

|              | Taxable amount | Tax              | Tax rate | Tax collected |
| :----------- | :------------- | :--------------- | :------- | :------------ |
| **Payments** | $20.00         | Multnomah County | 5%       | $1.00         |
| **Net**      | **$20.00**     |                  |          | **$1.00**     |

# Example 2: Two items have different tax rates

Wheat has a 10% wheat tax, and butter has a 5% butter tax. The net taxable amount is the same as the subtotal of the prices on the order.

**Order** 

| Item      | Price      | Tax        | Tax rate | Tax collected | Subtotal   |
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------- | :------- | :------------ | :--------- |
| Wheat     | $10.00     | Wheat tax  | 10%      | $1.00         | $11.00     |
| Butter    | $10.00     | Butter tax | 5%       | $0.50         | $10.50     |
| **Total** | **$20.00** |            |          | **$1.50**     | **$21.50** |

**Payment table** 

| Amount | Tax amount |
| :----- | :--------- |
| $21.50 | $1.50      |

**Payment tax rate table** 

| Taxable amount | Tax        | Tax rate |
| :------------- | :--------- | :------- |
| $10.00         | Wheat tax  | 10%      |
| $10.00         | Butter tax | 5%       |

|              | $10.00         | Butter tax | 5%       | $0.50         |
| **Net**      | **$20.00**     |            |          | **$1.50**     |

# Example 3: Two Default Taxes

Each item gets the same two taxes. The net taxable amount is NOT the sum of taxable amounts in the Payment tax rate table.

**Order** 

| Item      | Price      | Tax              | Tax rate | Tax collected | Subtotal   |

|           |            | Oregon state     | 10%      | $1.00         |            |
| Hammer    | $10.00     | Multnomah County | 5%       | $0.50         | $11.50     |

# Example 4: Two Items with Same Tax, One Item has a Special Tax

Both the items have the same tax rate, but one of the items has a special tax rate.

**Order** 

| Item      | Price      | Tax              | Tax rate | Tax collected | Subtotal   |
| :-------- | :--------- | :--------------- | :------- | :------------ | :--------- |

# Example 5: Items with Zero Tax or Merchants are Tax Exempt

Mark items with no tax as a 0% "No Tax Applied" tax. Merchants, such as nonprofits or schools, who are tax-exempt can remove tax from an order.

# Example 6: VAT (Value Added Tax)

With VAT, an advertised price of the item includes the tax rather than adding tax to the order total at the time of payment. Clover saves the advertised price with VAT as the taxable amount.

For example, if a pair of socks is advertised in Ireland at `â‚¬6` and the VAT is `20%`, the customer pays the `â‚¬6` and the merchant revenue is `â‚¬5`. The collected tax is `â‚¬1` (`â‚¬5 x 20%`). Clover saves the advertised price of `â‚¬6` and the `20%` VAT value.

**Order** 

| Item      | Advertised price | Revenue | Tax         | Tax rate | Tax collected | Subtotal  |
| :-------- | :--------------- | :------ | :---------- | :------- | :------------ | :-------- |
| Socks     | â‚¬6.00            | â‚¬5.00   | Ireland tax | 20%      | â‚¬1.00         | â‚¬6.00     |
| **Total** | **â‚¬6.00**        |         |             |          | **â‚¬1.00**     | **â‚¬6.00** |

| **Net**      | **â‚¬6.00**      |             |          | **â‚¬1.00**     |

# Example 7: VAT, Multiple Rates Per Item

Socks are advertised for â‚¬6. There are two VAT rates: 15% and 5%.

**Calculation**

- Revenue = â‚¬6 Ã· (1 + 0.15 + 0.05) = â‚¬5
- 15% tax = â‚¬5 x 0.15 = â‚¬0.75
- 5% tax = â‚¬5 x 0.05 = â‚¬0.25
- Total tax = â‚¬0.75 + 0.25 = â‚¬1.00

**Order** 

| Item      | Tax         | Tax Rate | Subtotal |
| :-------- | :---------- | :------- | :------- |
| **Socks** | Ireland Tax | 15%      | â‚¬6       |

# Example 8: Two Different Rate Objects with the Same Rate on the Same Order

A merchant has accidentally built their inventory using two 13.5% tax rate rows for the same tax and has assigned items to both tax rates. 

The order Includes:

- â‚¬4 bottle of water at a 13.5% rate #1
- â‚¬4 espresso at a 13.5% rate #2

With two different rates on the same order, Clover combines subtotals for each tax entity and separately rounds on a lower subtotal for the items taxed at each rate. Since the merchant is in Ireland, a VAT is included.

The tax code assumes that these rates are for separate entities and the tax paid calculations are separate for the water and the espresso. If there was only one 13.5% rate, the line item prices would be combined as â‚¬8 before calculating the tax. So it would use a larger total which leads to less rounding.

**Clover tax calculation**

- â‚¬4 at 13.5% rate #1 with the base price of â‚¬3.52 and â‚¬0.48 tax
- â‚¬4 at 13.5% rate #2 with the base price of â‚¬3.52 and â‚¬0.48 tax

**What the merchant expects**  
â‚¬8 at 13.5% with the base price of â‚¬7.05 and â‚¬0.95 tax

With two separate tax rates, there has to be more rounding, in this case, one more rounding up by one cent whereas there would be only one rounding with one tax rate.
