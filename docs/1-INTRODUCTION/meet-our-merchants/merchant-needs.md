## Clover merchants: by type of business

| Type of business         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accounting**           | Merchants process payroll weekly or bi-weekly, pay quarterly taxes, and balance expenses. Business owners may complete these tasks or work with a bookkeeper or accountant.                                                         |
| **Inventory Management** | Merchants must add new and seasonal items to inventory, update prices, keep track of what's in stock, be notified of things to be ordered, and easily re-stock items.                                                               |
| **Menu**                 | Restaurant owners create and update their menus, add seasonal appetizers and entrees, and set prices for regular items and specials.                                                                                                |
| **Sales**                | Merchants and their employees spend time with customers to determine what they like and need. Merchants must also attract new and repeat customers more frequently with discounts and specials to increase sales.                   |
| **Social Media**         | Social media is an important marketing tool. Therefore, many merchants post regularly on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media about specials, events, and other news. They also respond to social media reviews and check-ins. |
| **Employee Management**  | One of the most essential activities for business owners is to recruit, hire, and train new employees, in addition to tracking employee performance.                                                                                |
| **Cash Flow**            | Merchants monitor their cash flow to pay vendors and follow up on accounts receivable.                                                                                                                                              |
| **Customer Service**     | Good customer service is a top priority. This includes recognizing and rewarding loyal customers and handling special orders and requests.                                                                                          |
| **Marketing**            | Merchants get the word out about their business via advertising and social media. In addition, business owners network and interact with the local community.                                                                       |
