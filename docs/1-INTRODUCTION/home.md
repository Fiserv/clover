The Clover developer docs provides complete information about the APIs, SDKs, and other products which comprise the Clover developer platform." >

At Clover, we design and build low-cost and highly functional Android-based point of sale (POS) systems for small- or medium-sized businesses (SMBs). [Clover merchants](doc:meet-our-merchants) use our suite of apps for different business functions.

Clover is an open platform allowing third-party developers to build apps and integrate external POS systems with Clover devices.

### Reach over hundreds of thousands of merchants

Clover is the fastest-growing POS platform backed by Fiserv, a market leader processing over 50% of global card transactions. We currently operate in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Austria, and Argentina, and we are expanding to new regions to serve merchants around the globe.

### Connect on the Clover App Market

As a developer, you can make a difference and transform the way merchants run their business by saving time through intuitive apps on the [Clover App Market](https://www.clover.com/appmarket). Merchants are looking for solutions to make their small to medium businesses more efficient and profitable. Our open platform lets you seamlessly connect your apps and reach merchants in new ways.

### Monetize your app

Merchants spend millions of dollars each year on marketing, loyalty, accounting programs, and other services to run their businesses. Be a trailblazer and help merchants grow their business with your app on the Clover App Market. Developers receive 70% of the net subscription revenue. Learn more about [monetize your apps](doc:monetizing-your-apps).

# Get started

For most developers, the first step is to learn about the [Clover platform](doc:clover-architecture) and [development environments](doc:clover-environments). When you are ready to start, [select an integration type](doc:select-an-integration), [get a sandbox account](doc:get-started-with-sandbox-environment), and build your integration.

For example, on the Clover platform, you can:

- Build Android apps for Clover devices using the [Clover Android SDK](https://github.com/clover/clover-android-sdk). Your apps can leverage rich business data and Clover device hardware capabilities.
- Build web apps on the Clover platform using the [Clover REST API](ref:api-reference-overview). You can make authorized Clover REST API calls and help merchants manage their business better.
- Build apps using the [Ecommerce API](ref:charges) to integrate with Ecommerce services tailored to the needs of merchants.
- Use the [Clover Android Payments API](doc:using-clover-android-payments-api) to process payments from your Android app on different Clover device configurations without the need to be device-aware.
- [Integrate your point of sale (POS)](doc:clover-development-basics-semi) with Clover devices and accept Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliant dip, swipe, and tap payments.

# Use PCI security guidance for app developers

Clover devices run a custom version of the Android operating system (OS), so your apps need to be compatible with the Android OS. Use the [Payment Card Industry security guidance for app developers](https://docs.clover.com/docs/pci-security-guidance-for-app-developers) to get started with the data security standards and resources for safe payments using your apps on Clover devices.
