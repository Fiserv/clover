## What is online integration

An online integration lets your app retrieve and use data from any smart device. Clover provides online integration through the REST API, Ecommerce API, and the REST Pay Display API.

## How to do online integration

You can create a web app using REST architecture and publish it in the Clover App Market.â€¨Your app is accessible from the Clover Web dashboard and any smart device.

You need to:

- Use Clover APIs to pull and use merchant information with or without a payment function.
- Create secure checkouts anywhere you want to code.
