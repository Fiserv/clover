## What is a payment integration

Payment integrations let you process payments from any existing point of sale (POS) software or hardware. For example, your POS can leverage Clover payment functions using the Clover Connector SDK, Clover Android Payment API, and Payment Connector. 

## How to do a payment integration

When you connect your external (POS) to a Clover device to take payments, you can:

- Integrate with or without a Clover device and payments into any environment.
- Create secure checkouts anywhere you want to code.
- Deliver payment acceptance using Clover devices.
