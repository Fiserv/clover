You need to add bank account details to your verified Clover developer account to receive disbursements from Clover. You can add or update account bank details on the Developer Settings page on your production Developer Dashboard.

## Before you begin

Note the following:

- Clover supports only direct bank deposits and one bank account per developer account. It does not support any cash or check deposits. Make sure your bank account is always up-to-date on your Developer Dashboard.
- Clover recommends maintaining the current bank account linked to your developer account as open and active to avoid payment failure due to billing cycle nuances.
- Clover lets you directly update the bank account details in the Developer Dashboard. You do not need to send an email to the Developer Relations team for bank account updates.

## How Clover uses developer  bank account information

Clover uses the bank account information to:

- Pay your share from payments collected from merchants or businesses using your apps.
- Accept app fees in compliance with the Clover App Market Developer terms:
  - [US and Canada Clover App Market Developer Terms](https://www.clover.com/developer-agreement)
  - [Europe Clover App Market Developer Terms](https://eu.clover.com/developer-agreement)
