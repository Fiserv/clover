# What is PCI DSS

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) includes a wide range of security controls in the handling of card data and payment information. These controls cover aspects such as system configuration, policies, procedures, and permissions related to cardholder data. Secure software development and effective management play a crucial role in achieving PCI compliance.

PCI standards apply to various entities involved in payment card processing, regardless of their size or transaction volume. These includeâ€”card readers (both physical and virtual), point of sale devices, store networks and wireless access routers, payment card data storage and transmission (both electronic and paper),  E-commerce platforms, online payment gateways, and shopping carts. 

For more information, see [What is PCI compliance? The All-You-Need-to-Know Guide](https://www.clover.com/ca/small-business-resources/pci-compliance).

> ðŸ“˜ PCI DSS v4.0
> 
> PCI DSS v4.0 replaced v3.2.1 on March 31, 2024, and PCI DSS v4.0 documents are available for compliance assessment. Always see the information available in the [PCI Security Standards Council document library](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/document_library/?category=pcidss&hsCtaTracking=8aa4514c-37d0-40bc-b864-ed4c4aebb5de%7C8d5a5e5f-7860-4a8c-97cc-d91f17654660).

# Guidance for developers

For developers, the scope of PCI includes three key concepts:

- **Minimize data storage**â€”Keep as little customer data as necessary to minimize security risks.
- **Secure data handling**â€”Implement strong security measures for data both when stored and during transmission.
- **Vulnerability protection**â€”Make sure that information systems and software are protected from malicious attacks.
