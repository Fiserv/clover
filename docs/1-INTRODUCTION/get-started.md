- Use the [Clover Android SDK](https://github.com/clover/clover-android-sdk) to build Android apps that run on Clover devices. Your apps can leverage rich business data and Clover device hardware capabilities.
- Use the [Clover REST API](ref:api-reference-overview)to build web apps on the Clover platform. You can make authorized Clover REST API calls and help merchants manage their business better.
- Use the [Ecommerce API](ref:charges) to build apps that integrate with Ecommerce services in ways tailored to the needs of merchants.
- Use the [Clover Android Payments API] \(doc:using-clover-android-payments-api) to process payments from your Android app on different Clover device configurations, without the need to be device aware.

Your apps are published on the [Clover App Market](https://www.clover.com/appmarket).

The Clover platform also enables you to [integrate your own point-of-sale (POS)](doc:clover-development-basics-semi) with Clover devices and accept payment card industry (PCI)-compliant dip, swipe, and tap payments.
