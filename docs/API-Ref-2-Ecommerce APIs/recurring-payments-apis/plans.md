Use the **Plans API** to create recurring charges/payment plans that merchants offer to customers to initiate scheduled automatic payments. Each plan defines a fixed payment amount, periodic frequency, tax, convenience fees, tips, and so on. See [Recurring Payments APIs - Configuring Plans](docs:working-with-recurring-payments-and-subscriptions) for steps to define recurring charges/payment plans. You must define your **plans** (recurring charges) before configuring  **subscriptions** (scheduled automatic payments).
