Use the **Subscriptions API** to create subscriptions that associate a customer to a recurring charges/payments plan, including the card-on-file, the scheduled amount, and the automatic payment dates. See [Recurring Payments APIs - Configuring Subscriptions](doc:recurring-apis-subscriptions) for steps to configure a subscription. You must define your **plans** (recurring charges) before configuring  **subscriptions** (scheduled automatic payments).
