Use the Recurring Payments APIs to set up periodically recurring charges, such as monthly or weekly, and allow customers to schedule automatic payments. Define your **plans** (recurring charges/payment plans) before configuring your **subscriptions** (scheduled automatic payments). See [Recurring Payments and Subscriptions APIs](doc:working-with-recurring-payments-and-subscriptions) for guidance on using these APIs.
